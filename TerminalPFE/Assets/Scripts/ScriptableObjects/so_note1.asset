  description: "Corra,\r\n\r\nWe're definitely going to join the others. It has become
    too dangerous to live over there. If we wait any longer, we won't be able to
    get through the town. Please, do not be stubborn. No one wants to leave you alone.\r\nChloe
    needs you. I need you. \r\nWe'll be on the corner of Eser\u2019s Street in a
    house with lime colored shutters. We will be there until dawn.\r\nDon't die for
    nothing. They are not the solution anymore. \r\nWe are waiting for you. Be safe.
    \n\r\nStephen.\r\n"
