  description: "Corra,\r\n\r\nWe're definitely going to join the others. It has become
    too dangerous to live over here. If we wait too long, we won't be able to get
    through the town. Please don't be stubborn. No one wants to leave you there.\r\nChloe
    needs you. I need you. \r\nIf you find this, we'll be on the corner of Eser\u2019s
    Street in a house with lime shutters. We will be there until dawn.\r\nDon't die
    for nothing. They are not solutions anymore. \r\n\r\nStephen.\r\n"
