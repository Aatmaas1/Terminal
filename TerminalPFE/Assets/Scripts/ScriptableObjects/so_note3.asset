  description: "January 21, 2122\r\n\r\nIt's 4am and I'm so fucking excited ! I can\u2019t
    fall asleep. I finally succeeded. Yeas babe !! I did it ! I freed the bees from
    their dead queen. \r\nToday is the great rebound of humanity, I\u2019m convinced.\r\nThey
    all stare at me as I was their mother. Or their god I dnt know.\r\nI swear I
    could burn to know what's going on in their mind. All these new thoughts which
    must swarm through their head like embers in the wind.\r\nI would have loved
    to share all the beauties i see everyday.\r\n\r\nI could get back soon. Miss
    u all. \r\n\r\nCorra\r\n"
