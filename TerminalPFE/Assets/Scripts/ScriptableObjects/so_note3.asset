  description: "January 21, 2122\r\n\r\nIt's 4 A.M. I'm feeling so fucking ecstatic
    I can\u2019t fall asleep !! I finally succeeded !! Goddamnit, yess !! I did it
    !!!!! I freed the bees from their dead queen. \r\nToday is the great rebound
    of humanity, that\u2019s for sure.\r\nThey\u2019re all staring at me as if I
    were their mother or their god, I don\u2019t know.\r\nI\u2019m so eager to know
    everything going on in their mind. All these thoughts, swarming in their heads
    like embers in the wind.\r\nI would have loved to share all of this with someone.
    \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll be back soon. \r\nMiss y\u2019all. \r\n\r\nCorra\r\n"
  commentaireAndroid: 'Queens. Bees. Both captive by their own purpose. Provide the
    next.
